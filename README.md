### Hi Crowdflower!

To install all dependencies for the application run:
```bash
npm install
```
Once that is complete you can start it by running:
```bash
npm start
```
You can access the app by going to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. A proxy 
has been set up in the `package.json` to redirect api requests to:

You can run the tests by running:
```bash
npm test
```

Enjoy!
